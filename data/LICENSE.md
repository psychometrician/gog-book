# The book's example data — provenance and terms

These CSVs are the tables every chapter of *gog: A Grammar of Graphics* draws
from. They are published so that a reader can run the manual's examples in R,
Python, Julia or JavaScript, rather than only read them.

They are built by `book/R/make-data.R`, or downloaded from public records by
`book/R/fetch-data.R`, and read by `book/R/data.R`. The ruling that put them
here is spec §20, "The cast is fetched, not shipped".

Five tiers, and they are not under one license.

## Original to this book — Apache License 2.0

These frames are written out as literals or generated from a fixed seed by
this project's author, and carry the same license as the rest of the code:

`actuals` · `banded` · `botswana_arrow` · `botswana_label` · `budget` · `capitals` ·
`cashflow` · `census` · `channel_sales` · `cities` · `coefs` · `commutes` ·
`day_cycle` · `decay` · `departments` · `depth_readings` · `drawdown` ·
`equator` · `far_north` · `flight` · `forecast` · `gdp_threshold` ·
`income_note` · `inventory` · `life_bands` · `listening` · `medal_repeats` ·
`medals` · `milestones` · `mixed_signs` · `monitoring` · `nutrients` ·
`octaves` · `policy_rates` · `prevailing_winds` · `quarterly` · `receipts` ·
`recessions` · `revenue` · `ripples` · `routes` · `sales_box` · `score_band` ·
`scrambled` · `sessions` · `six_weeks` · `slump` · `span_early` ·
`span_late` · `span_middle` · `speed_target` · `spending` · `spiral` ·
`target_band` · `target_edges` · `team_trend` · `tenure` · `thermal_marks` ·
`thermals` · `tide` · `winds`

Illustrative rather than authoritative. `census` is two plausible city age
profiles, not a census; `medals` is a medal table's shape, not a record of any
particular games. Do not cite them as data about the world.

## Derived from gapminder — CC0 1.0 (public domain)

These frames are cuts of the `gapminder` R package's table, with three columns
renamed for readability (`gdpPercap` → `gdp`, `lifeExp` → `life`,
`pop` → `population`). `gm_europe_cdf` is the one derivation rather than a cut:
`gm_europe`'s life expectancies sorted, with the running share of countries
beside each one.

`gm_all` · `gapminder_2007` · `gapminder_asia` · `gm_asia` · `gm_continents` · `gm_eras` ·
`gm_europe` · `gm_europe_cdf` · `healthy_band` · `world_median`

`population_spikes` draws on this table and on Natural Earth's, below: a
country's population set at the middle of its own outline.

The `gapminder` package is released under **CC0 1.0**, a public domain
dedication, so no permission or attribution is required. It is credited anyway:
the package is by Jennifer Bryan, and the underlying figures are the Gapminder
Foundation's — <https://www.gapminder.org/data/>.

## Derived from R's `datasets` package and HistData — GPL-2 | GPL-3

These frames are reshaped from tables that ship with R itself, and one from
Michael Friendly's HistData package, which carries the same license:

| Frame | From | Reshaping |
|---|---|---|
| `iris_flowers` | `datasets::iris` | columns renamed to bare words |
| `maunga_whau` | `datasets::volcano` | matrix unrolled to long form, every second row and column |
| `quakes_fiji` | `datasets::quakes` | depth negated to an elevation, and cut into 90 km bands |
| `titanic` | `datasets::Titanic` | the four-way table unrolled to long form, columns renamed to bare words |
| `nightingale` | `HistData::Nightingale` | the monthly deaths from each of three causes unrolled to long form, one row per month and cause; `period` names the year of the war, April to March, and the rates and army sizes are left out |

**These are GPL, and that is why nothing here is shipped inside a package.** R's
`datasets` is licensed GPL-2 | GPL-3, and HistData `GPL`, which R reads as the
same two versions. That is copyleft, and it cannot be absorbed into an
Apache-2.0 wheel or tarball. Hosting them beside the book is ordinary
distribution, which the GPL permits when its terms travel with the files — this
note is that. A reader who uses these frames is using GPL data and should
treat it accordingly.

The underlying observations are old and public: Edgar Anderson's iris
measurements published by R. A. Fisher in 1936, a 1967 topographic survey of
Maungawhau in Auckland, seismic events near Fiji, and the deaths in the British
army in the Crimean War from 1854 to 1856, which Florence Nightingale compiled
and which Pearson and Short transcribed in 2007. The GPL attaches to the
packages' compilations of them, not to the facts.

## Derived from Natural Earth — public domain

One frame carries the world's coastlines and borders:

| Frame | From | Reshaping |
|---|---|---|
| `world_borders` | Natural Earth `ne_110m_admin_0_countries` | polygons unrolled to one row per vertex, rings numbered into `piece`, simplified, Antarctica dropped |

Natural Earth places its data in the **public domain** and asks for no
permission and no attribution: *"All versions of Natural Earth raster and vector
map data found on this website are in the public domain. You may use the maps in
any manner, including modifying the content and design, electronic
dissemination, and offset printing."* It is credited here because saying where a
map came from is good practice, not because the terms require it.

The reshaping is what makes it a table rather than a shapefile, and it is the
same shape any boundary data has to arrive in: **one row per vertex**, with a
column naming the ring each vertex belongs to. A country is not always one
closed shape — islands are separate rings, and a country lying wholly inside
another is a ring of its own — so `piece` counts rings, not countries.

Simplified at roughly a third of a degree, which is invisible at the size the
book draws and is what keeps the file small. Antarctica is dropped because at
this resolution its coastline is a ragged strip cut off at the bottom of the
data rather than a shape, and a reader would fairly read that as a bug.

## Public records of US government agencies — public domain

Four frames are real observations, downloaded and reshaped by
`book/R/fetch-data.R`:

| Frame | From | Reshaping |
|---|---|---|
| `cyclones` | NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information, International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS), version 4.01 | storms whose one-minute wind (`USA_WIND`) reached 64 knots, 1980 to 2025; a position every twelve hours while the wind was at least 34 knots; `spur` tracks dropped; each storm named by its name and first year, or by IBTrACS's identifier when it has no name of its own; `category` is its highest Saffir-Simpson category, in three bands |
| `quakes_2011` | US Geological Survey, ANSS Comprehensive Earthquake Catalog (ComCat) | every earthquake of magnitude 5 or more in 2011, with a row in the week it struck and in each of the next three weeks; `age` says which |
| `us_counties` | US Census Bureau, 2023 Cartographic Boundary File for counties at 1:20,000,000, and the 2023 Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE) | the counties of the 48 states between Canada and Mexico, and the District of Columbia; polygons unrolled to one row per vertex, rings named in `piece`, simplified to a twentieth of a degree, with a ring that would close up kept finer; `poverty` is the estimated percent of people of all ages in poverty, joined by FIPS code to every row of the county's outline |
| `ohio_turnout` | US Election Assistance Commission, Election Administration and Voting Survey (EAVS) for 2016, 2020 and 2024; US Census Bureau, Citizen Voting Age Population (CVAP) special tabulations from the American Community Survey, 2012–2016, 2016–2020 and 2020–2024; and the county outlines of `us_counties` | Ohio's 88 counties, once for each election; outlines simplified to a two-hundredth of a degree; `turnout` is EAVS item F1a, the ballots counted, as a percent of the CVAP estimate for the five years ending in the election year, joined by FIPS code to every row of the county's outline |

IBTrACS gathers each storm's record from the forecasting agencies that tracked
it, in several countries. The wind speeds used here are the US agencies' own,
averaged over one minute, which is the measure the Saffir-Simpson scale is
defined on.
